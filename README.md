## 🚀 Overview

**Motorsports** is a team management platform tailored for motorsports organizations. It handles everything from driver and crew management to scheduling, race-day logistics, and performance tracking — with a backend built in TypeScript and automated tooling in Shell.

What makes this project unique is its **autonomous daily improvement cycle**: an AI agent (Manus) reviews the codebase each day, identifies gaps, and pushes enhancements automatically — so the platform gets smarter and more capable without manual intervention.

---

## 🤖 Daily Self-Building via Manus

> **⚡ This project is actively self-improving — every single day.**

This repository runs a **scheduled daily workflow powered by [Manus](https://manus.im)**, an autonomous AI agent capable of planning, coding, testing, and committing improvements on its own.

### How It Works

Each day, the Manus agent:

1. **Reviews** the current state of the codebase and reads `DAILY_PROMPT.md` for its standing instructions
2. **Analyzes** the `changelog.md` and `project_plan.md` to understand what's been done and what's next
3. **Implements** the next prioritized improvement — adding features, fixing bugs, refactoring, or extending the backend
4. **Tests** its changes against the existing backend logic
5. **Commits and documents** the work, updating `changelog.md` with a timestamped entry

### Key Files Driving the Automation

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`DAILY_PROMPT.md`](./DAILY_PROMPT.md) | Standing instructions for Manus — defines goals, constraints, and improvement priorities |
| [`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md) | Documents the full autonomous workflow Manus follows each session |
| [`project_plan.md`](./project_plan.md) | The living roadmap — Manus reads this to pick the next task |
| [`changelog.md`](./changelog.md) | Auto-updated log of every change Manus makes, with dates and descriptions |

### Why This Matters

Traditional projects require a developer to sit down, plan, and execute changes. This project **runs itself**. The daily build cycle means:

- Features ship continuously without manual sprints
- The codebase self-documents its own evolution
- Bugs get surfaced and resolved proactively
- The project plan stays in sync with actual progress

## 🐳 Docker Deployment (Production)

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/navigatingnc/Motorsports.git
cd Motorsports

# 2. Create your environment file
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env — at minimum set POSTGRES_PASSWORD and JWT_SECRET

# 3. Build and start all services
docker compose up --build -d

# 4. Open the app
open http://localhost
```

The stack starts three containers:

| Container | Role | Port |
|---|---|---|
| `motorsports_db` | PostgreSQL 16 | internal only |
| `motorsports_backend` | Express API | internal only |
| `motorsports_frontend` | nginx + React SPA | `80` (host) |

The backend runs `prisma migrate deploy` automatically on startup, so the database schema is always up to date.

### Development with Docker

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

This override mounts source directories and enables hot-reload for both the backend (ts-node) and frontend (Vite dev server on port 5173).

---

## 🏃 Getting Started (Works even if `pnpm` is missing)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/navigatingnc/Motorsports.git
cd Motorsports

# One-time setup (installs backend + frontend deps and generates Prisma client)
./setup.sh

# Start backend + frontend together
./dev-start.sh
```

### What `setup.sh` does

- Uses `pnpm` if already installed.
- If `pnpm` is not installed, it bootstraps it with `corepack` automatically.
- Falls back to `npm` only when `pnpm` cannot be bootstrapped.
- Installs backend/frontend dependencies and runs Prisma client generation.

### Verified local run sequence

```bash
./setup.sh
./dev-start.sh
```

This sequence has been validated in this repository.
